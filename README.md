# Welcome to `formaxt`!
A text editor with the ability to use multiple markup languages at once! Although, why would you ever need this? No, you wouldn't. This is just a fun conceptual project to play with (I hope I used that word right) and also it means I don't have to learn every nook and cranny of LaTeX while writing my documents. Instead of
```
<p><b>Hello world!</b> Yay!</p>
```
I can do 
```
<p>*Hello world!* Yay!</p>
```
And have it do the same output! LaTeX is also annoying, what even is:
```
Hello world! \textbf{yay!}
```
And now:
```
Hello world! **Yay!**
```
Or even
```
Hello world! <b>Yay!</b>
```
<sup>Why would you ever do this</sup><br>
People are going to scream at me for doing this, but eh. It's probably impractical anyway, but it's fun.

**NOTE: THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.**
